                or applicable law lets you do so.</p><br/>

            <h4><b>In case of problems or disagreements</b></h4><br/>

            <p>These terms only limit our responsibilities as allowed by applicable law. Specifically, these terms don’t
                limit our liability for death or personal injury, fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, gross negligence,
                or willful misconduct. Other than the rights and responsibilities described in this terms, we won’t be
                responsible for any losses, unless they’re caused by our breach of these terms.</p><br/>

            <p>If we reasonably believe that any of your content (1) breaches these terms (2) violates applicable
                law, or (3) could harm our users, third parties, or Express To Match, then we reserve the right to
                take down some or all of that content in accordance with applicable law. Examples include child
                pornography, content that facilitates human trafficking or harassment, content that promotes profanity, and content that infringes
                someone else’s Intellectual
                Property rights. In all these cases, and other situations as deemed inappropriate conduct per our
                discretion, we reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the services or delete your
                Account, without further explanation.</p><br/>

            <h4><b>About these terms</b></h4><br/>

            <p>By law, you have certain rights that can’t be limited by a contract like these terms of service. These
                terms
                are in no way intended to restrict those rights.</p><br/>

            <p>These terms describe the relationship between you and Express To match. They don’t create any legal
                rights
                for other people or organizations, even if others benefit from that relationship under these terms.</p>
            <br/>

            <p>We want to make these terms easy to understand and use. Not all services we provide may be applicable in
                your country.</p><br/>

            <p>If it turns out that a particular term is not valid or enforceable, this will not affect any other
                terms.</p><br/>

            <p>If you don’t follow these terms or the service-specific additional terms, and we don’t take action right
                away, that doesn’t mean we’re giving up any rights that we may have, such as taking action in the
                future.</p><br/>

            <p>We may update these terms (1) to reflect changes in our services or how we do business — for example,
                when
                we add new services, features, technologies, pricing, or benefits (or remove old ones), (2) for legal,
                regulatory, or security reasons, or (3) to prevent abuse or harm.</p><br/>

            <p>If we materially change these terms, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice and the opportunity
                to
                review the changes, except (1) when we launch a new service or feature, or (2) in urgent situations,
                such as
                preventing ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements. If you don’t agree to the new terms, you
                should remove your content and stop using the services. You can also end your relationship with us at
                any
                time by closing your Express To Match Account.</p><br/>
